title: Dev Where'd You Go
---

In short:

- Personal laptop was given to sibling for education
- [Carpal tunnel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome)
- A lot more work in work
- A lot more life in life

Or, you could group them all under the common name of "excuses".

Sorry for the zero work done lately (and to come), but I still respond as fast as I can on emails (or on Helma when summoned).
