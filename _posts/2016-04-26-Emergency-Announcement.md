title: Emergency Announcement
---

This is an emergency announcement. We are currently having issues with Helma, and it is more or less in a lockdown now. Discussion can be found [here](http://desustorage.org/c/thread/2638250), but desustorage appears to be down for me as well. Not a good day to start with today.

> Don't know if any of you go to helma, but we just had a major problem (site hit an arbitrary, unlisted space limit) and I don't know if it can be fixed because the host is 99% dead and I don't even think I can contact them. I can't even access cpanel anymore. I have everything backed up and current -except- /sw/, which is a several month old backup (this happened while I was trying to backup /sw/)..
> 
> This could be fixed by tomorrow, or never, depending on if I ever get a reply.

> Funnily enough the whole reason I was backing up the site in the first place was because I was planning on doing exactly that. I was hoping to start the transfer about a week from now.

> Wost case is that everything will be completely restored on a new host, except /sw/ which will be several months, maybe even over half a year behind.

HelmaAdmin has contacted the site host support, but from past experience, they are hardly responsive. For the moment, we will have to wait for their response first. I will update this post accordingly.
