title: Messed up sidebar
---

After getting some feedbacks ([>>9591](http://helma.us/sw/res/7379.html#reply9591), [>>9632](http://helma.us/sw/res/7379.html#reply9632)) from users, looks like I messed up with the sidebar update. Sorry guys.

I thought I could just shim it and start moving on to the new templates. Turns out I missed out the fact that this shim will be living with some imageboard templates (textboard and oekaki), as I will not be supporting them, yet. Also, some users who have hidden the sidebar before this are surprised, and the situation was made worse with the lack of control to show/hide the new sidebar.

I'm currently wrapping up on a more proper fix, and hopefully we'll be able to apply it by tomorrow. Maybe I'll fix [#12](https://github.com/altbdoor/kusaba-helma/issues/12) too while I'm on a roll.
